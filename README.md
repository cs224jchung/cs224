=====

This was a project for cs224 Project 7 polymorphism ALU

=====

List of all the classes:

aluGenerator.java // generates a random sequence of nucleotides as an ALU

appendALU.java // File that appends the ALU to random locations

appendEasy.java // My attempt to work on the base easy case of the project.

genomeGenerator.java // generates a random sequence of 3Billion

hashDonor.java // hashTest

Hirschberg.java // Method of finding perfect matches of ALU in a read

homebrew.java // Compression of Genome

KMPplus.java // Slide method for finding matches of ALU in a read

Pager.java // breaks down the full genome into smaller 4MB files

threadALUr.java // Threads the ALU insertion

Legacy:  // contains files that are no longer part of project
	addALU.java //
